Introduction to Flask & Setup: What is Flask? Why use it? Setting up a Conda environment and installing Flask. (Today)
Your First Flask App: A basic "Hello, World!" application. Understanding routes and the app object.
Templates & Rendering: Using Jinja2 templates to separate logic from presentation. Passing data to templates.
Static Files: Serving CSS, JavaScript, and images.
Request Handling: Accessing data sent by the user (form data, URL parameters).
Forms & User Input: Working with HTML forms and validating user data.
Databases (SQLite): Connecting to a database and performing basic operations.
More Advanced Topics (Optional): User authentication, sessions, and scaling."
